# Calculator Front End

React Bootstrap Vite Calculator web application.



## Run Locally

This project requires Node version 16 or higher. The dependency can be solved using nvm.

```bash
  brew install nvm
  nvm install 16
  nvm use 16
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server, on port 5173 using the build tool Vite. This can be changed by altering the .env file

```bash
  npm run dev
```


## Running Tests

The setup unfortunately took longer than desired to intigrate with Vite. Thus I had to leave them out.
